This is a learning project: experiments with Swift. 

It's a mash-up between this tutorial (http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/introduction-to-tiled-map-editor-a-great-platform-agnostic-tool-for-making-level-maps--gamedev-2838) and a game found in this book (http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-games-by-tutorials).
